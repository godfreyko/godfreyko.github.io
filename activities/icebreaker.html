            <h1>Icebreaker</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The icebreaker for this course will be a bit different that what you may have experienced in the past.
                While there will be an element of introduction, we are less concerned with where you are from, and more
                concerned with your ability to think and contribute meaningfully to a conversation.</p>

            <h2>Prepare</h2>
            <p>Begin your preparation for this activity by choosing ?? case studies from the list below. Read and
                ponder the lessons to be learned about project management from the case study.</p>

            <h2>Post</h2>
            <p>Once you have formulated your thoughts post them in the icebreaker discussion board. Try to do this
                early in the week.</p>

            <h2>Reply</h2>
            <p>Later in the week read and reply to other posts. Focus on generating thoughtful responses. You are not
                evaluated on quantity here but quality.</p>
            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Take a bit of time to read over the threads of the discussion. Read them with the following perspective:
                In weeks 2 and 3 you will be choosing a path for the course, proposing a project, and then either
                building a team for your proposal <strong>OR</strong> joining the team for someone else's project.</p>
            <p>See if you can answer the following questions about your peers from their responses:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How well might I work with this person?</li>
                <li>Are they thoughtful?</li>
                <li>Did they actually contribute to the conversation?</li>
                <li>Are they considerate?</li>
                <li>How well did they complete this simple activity?</li>
                <li>What do my posts tell my classmates about me?</li>

            </ol>
