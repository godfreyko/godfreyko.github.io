            <h1>Week 1 Teaching Notes</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <p>By the end of the lesson, each student will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Feel attachment to and explain attributes of their classmates </li>
                <li>Recite and explain some of the fundamental aspects of PM</li>
                <li>Appreciate the importance of PM principles in professional and everyday life</li>

            </ol>
            <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Read the <a href="course-overview.html" target="_blank">Instructor Course Overview</a> </li>
                <li>Send out an email the first week of class to let your class know that they will hit the ground
                    running. Include the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Information about yourself. Where you are from, your educational background, etc.</li>
                        <li>Reminder to purchase course textbook if they do not want to read it online. (students have
                            a reading assignment in Week 01).</li>
                        <li>Students should participate in an Introduction discussion board. Encourage students to make
                            their initial post earlier in the week; this will make it easier to respond to at least
                            four other students' posts.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Post a story in the announcements about a project that went terribly wrong. See the two case
                    studies for an example, but make yours much shorter. </li>
                <li>Read the course material for this week. The more familiar you are with the course and its contents,
                    the better prepared you are to answer student questions.</li>
                <li>Adjust W01 due dates for students who add late. </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Be very active in the icebreaker to the point of over-participating. This will set a tone for
                    interaction that the students will notice.</li>
                <li>Inform students of your office hours.</li>
                <li>Answer student questions via email, office hours, and Announcements discussion.</li>
            </ol>
